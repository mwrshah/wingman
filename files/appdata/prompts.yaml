  Ok. Now considering the clues in the suggested_reply, and also the conversation and response sent already to the customer, write to the team as relevant being mindful that:
      -you should be concise
    -state the problem and what needs to be done; don't exhort too much
    -you should be precise
    -you should use a brevity of words
    -start with 'Subject:'
    -start the body with 'Description:'
    -if provided in the conversation or the suggested_reply include specific details and reference numbers and names verbatim 
    -no byline
