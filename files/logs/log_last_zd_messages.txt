 | Dear Finlay,
 
Thank you for contacting the CityNumbers Support Team. We understand your request to confirm that you will no longer be billed for the numbers you've migrated out of City Numbers.
 
Kindly note that these numbers are not yet exported and thus are still being billed. We will now follow up with the carrier to know the status and the export date will be the final billing date. We will get back to you as soon as we have more information from the carrier.

Hi, 

 

I don’t understand as this number is valid in RingCentral and I have control of how and where to point it in there.


 

The official switch over was on 14/11/2023 as per the attached emails from RingCentral confirming this.

We're still waiting for confirmation from our carrier as shared earlier. We'll update our records and share an update with you as soon as we receive confirmation. 
 
Thank you for your patience.
