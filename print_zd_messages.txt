 | Hi Amir,
in the past there was a general manual available - as I can remember in the worx community.
I dont want support from the PS because we do it on our own. We just need the general manual / instruction from you as manufacturer of the software. No custom stuff.
Can you please check again whether there is an instruction guide available in youe document archive?
Regards Lars
